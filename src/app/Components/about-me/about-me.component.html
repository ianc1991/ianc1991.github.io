        <p> My name is Ian. I was born in NE Mississippi and now live on the East coast of Florida!
            Some of my interests include coding/web design, playing guitar, gaming, and more.
            I have experience developing web pages in Angular and Windows applications in C#. 
            Hopefully, I will have some great examples of my work on this site soon!
